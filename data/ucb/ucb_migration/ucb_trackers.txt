This medical review concluded that given that “mania” and “hypomania” are listed events in the current US label for alprazolam (for the narrowly defined sub-population of patients with depression), this is considered to be a validated safety observation. However, as noted above, there are data to suggest that mania and hypomania are also prevalent in the general population of patients taking alprazolam (i.e., the Micromedex data as well as the Xanax® brand product label). Furthermore, it is recommended to discontinue “special monitoring”, surveillance of this particular adverse event should be conducted by the standard PhV practices and procedures of UCB. There does not appear to be any available information or data that would warrant any additional safety signal assessment activities at this time.

However, the available pre-clinical data and their low relevance for man should be reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPCs of amiodarone containing products as follows: In a 2-years carcinogenicity study in rats, amiodarone caused an increase in thyroid follicular tumours (adenomas and/or carcinomas) in both sexes at clinical relevant exposures. Since mutagenicity findings were negative, an epigenic rather than genotoxic mechanism is proposed for this type of tumour induction. In the mouse, carcinomas were not observed, but a dose-dependent thyroid follicular hyperplasia was seen. These effects on the thyroid in rats and mice are most likely due to effects of amiodarone on the synthesis and/or release of thyroid gland hormones. The relevance of these findings to man is low. The MAHs of amiodarone containing products should submit a variation to the NCAs within two months.

Knowles et al (1995) described a case study of azathioprine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome where the time to onset (15 days) may be suggestive of DRESS.

NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Complete	NA	"Event noted upon review of DSUR LL's. Queries sent for better documentation of the case 068558.12Nov13: Drug-Induced Acute Pancreatitis (DIAP). Follow-up received described a 50-year-old male from Poland who developed acute pancreatitis approximately 4 months after start of BRV and was assessed as related to BRV.  PMH and conmeds have not been provided. Safety database review: A second ICSR of acute pancreatitis # 8028275 was identified.  This report described a 41-year-old female who developed acute pancreatitis after 1 week of BRV exposure in the OL trial and 12 weeks of exposure to PBO in the double blind study.  Her PMH included hypothyroidism and Crohn’s Disease.  Her conmeds included valproate, warfarin, piracetam, primidone, topiramate, clonazepam, norethisterone (an OCP), levothyroxine, pantoprazole, chloral hydrate, and doloxetine.   Literature (UpToDate©) indicates that DIAP is rare and represents 0.3-1.4% of all cases of acute pancreatitis. Several medications have been associated with drug induced pancreatitis and a number of different mechanisms of drug-induced pancreatitis have been proposed.  These mechanisms include immunologic reactions, direct toxic effect, accumulation of a toxic metabolite (eg, valproate), ischemia, intravascular thrombosis and an increased viscosity of pancreatic juice.  TTO depends upon the drug involved from a few weeks after beginning a drug associated with an immunologically mediated adverse reaction to many months of use for patients taking valproate, pentamidine, or didanosine presumably due to the chronic accumulation of toxic metabolic products. The prognosis of drug-induced pancreatitis is generally excellent and mortality is low.  Additionally, literature classifies drugs into 4 categories (I-IV) respective of the likelihood of a causal association with acute pancreatitis, from highest (I) to lowest (IV).  Discussion: The former ICSR has insufficient information to validate or refute the SO.  The latter ICSR is not consistent with DIAP caused by BRV.  Valproate is a category I drug and the TTO is consistent with causality due to valproate (TTO several years) more so than BRV (TTO 1 week).  However, the pancreatitis did not resolve until 11 months after dechallenge, which is  inconsistent with a drug etiology since DIAP the prognosis is generally excellent with complete resolution after dechallenge.   29Jan14 progress note: Issue reassessed according to schedule.  F/U received for ICSR# 068558, including PMH & conmeds.  No new pancreatitis cases were identified.   Subject received valproate (class 1a Badalov-Baradarian classification) and ketoprofen (class 4).  TTO is much more consistent with valproate causality than BRV.  Safety observation closed.  To be reassessed if further relevant ICSRs are identified.   30Apr14 UPDATE: 50 YO male from Poland in the N01379 ADJUNCTIVE treatment study.  The latest F/U received from DR ANDRZEJ SZCZUDLIK states that conmeds were lisinopril and alfa calcidol (only?).  So, either subject was on a concomitant AED, in which case we need to know what it was (especially if it was valproate a class A1 cause for pancreatitis ) or he was not, in which case this may have been a protocol violation.  Request sent to clinical team to ask PI for clarification.  23Jul14: Follow-up confirmed subjectin case  068558 was on valproate class 1a causal drug."Brivaracetam - 11	11	Brivaracetam	All	POS	McDonough	Cholelithiasis and raised GGT	No	N	15	Hepatobiliary disorders	ET	UCB	3/17/2014	L	N	5/29/2014	Incidence of both not higher than what would be expected in a general population	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	Complete	N/A	NilBrivaracetam - 12	12	Brivaracetam	All	POS	McDonough	Suicidality	No	Y	74	Psychiatric disorders	Analysis prior submission	UCB	6/30/2014	M	Y	Already in RMP	Previous signal confirmed.

The investigator considered the elevated CPK (rhabdomyolysis) as a manifestation of the underlying dermatomyositis.  Given the TTO of 5 years and the presence of dermatomyositis –known to cause CPK elevation/rhabdomyolysis- the safety observation was not validated for drug induced rhabdomyolysis.  Literature review was performed and in 1 series of patients with inflammatory myopathies (>150), only 2 had normal CPK levels.  This  confirmed the investigator’s assessment and showed elevated CPK as a manifestation of inflammatory myopathies.   Safety database revealed 1 other report of rhabdomyolysis (059467), which described a 58-year-old male who developed recurrent seizures and difficulty moving leading him to lie down on his right side of the body for a long time.

Section 4.8 of the CCDS mentioned that clinical studies have shown that cetirizine at the recommended dosage has minor adverse effects on the CNS, including somnolence, fatigue, dizziness and headache. In Section 4.9, it is mentioned that symptoms observed after an overdose of cetirizine are mainly associated with CNS effects or with effects that could suggest an anticholinergic effect. Adverse events reported after an intake of at least 5 times the recommended daily dose are for example: confusion,  dizziness, fatigue, headache, malaise, restlessness, sedation, somnolence, stupor and tremor. Further more, symptoms observed after an overdose of cetirizine in some patients is respiratory failure, which can be lethal.Respiratory depression in children under 2 years of age: in PSUR covering 06-Nov-2009 to 05-Nov-2012 there were no cases specifically reporting respiratory depression but one poorly documented case from Australia describing dyspnoea was identified (009415). PSUR concluded that this isolated report did not provide sufficient evidence to support a safety signal but close monitoring was continued.CNS depression in children under the age of 2 years: In PSUR covering 06-Nov-2009 to 05-Nov-2012, a total of nine cases were identified and reviewed but they did not constitute a safety signal.

The two data sources they used are not necessarily compatible, and the amount of valid cases discussed (about 48 for ceti, 15 for levo) are not statistically significant without case details to determine real validity. In addition, exposure to the antihistamines in certain countries were calculated based on certain assumptions, and to the authors’ admission, these numbers were not always exact. In addition, the disorders discussed are broad (from QT prolongation to ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest). In Empirica Signal, none of the closed signals for cetirizine or levocetirizine concerned cardiac events. A few cardiac events have previously been assessed as SOVs for either levocetirizine or cetirizine: arrythmia, QT prolongation, palpitations and atrial fibrillation with special attention to patients with history of atrial fibrillation as predisposing factor.

However, we are limited in what we can glean from this paper because the authors grouped the medications as anti-emetics:  meclozine, meclozine/pyridoxine, cyclizine  and ‘other’ antihistamines:  cetirizine, levoceterizine, amino-akyl ethers, phenothiazine.  As such, we have no specific ORs for meclozine, cetirizine, or levocetirizine and these defects per se. Because of this, it is not considered this single article to necessitate a safety observation at this time. The paper describes two case control studies (HAVEN and Eurocat Registry).  While there is the potential for recall bias (mothers of affected children may recall their use of medication differently than mothers of healthy infants) particularly after 2 years, the authors had to wait at least one year to interview mothers in order to assure complete ascertainment of cases as infant heart defects can be detected up to a year past birth.  Furthermore, the Eurocat study used infants with hip dysplasia (another birth defect not associated with antihistamine use) as their controls (which would reduce the potential for recall bias) and also used prescription records as the primary source of exposure data."

Morea therapy is indicated for second line treatment of acne, hirsutism and seborrhea and should be discontinued 3 to 4 cycles after the symptoms have subsided. Long term therapy is not intended and therefore a temporal association is unlikely.One literature case was identified within the UCB Argus safety database.  This case originated from a publication by Miquel et al (2007) and describes an elderly male patient, who took 150mg/day cyproterone acetate for advanced prostatic carcinoma and developed hepatotoxicity after previous flutamide induced hepatotoxicity. Morea sanol tablets contain 2mg cyproterone acetate. The patient received a daily dose that was 75-fold higher, a value that wouldn´t be reached with the UCB therapeutic dose. Furthermore Morea therapy is indicated for women of childbearing age only therefore potential risks in male patients should be low to nonexistent if used as indicated.The UCB oral Morea sanol (ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate) combination is not intended to be used for long term use, or indications such as endometriosis or prostate cancer.  There is a current lack of sufficient evidence concerning autoimmune hepatitis and microvesicular steatosis associated with labelled use of Morea sanol. The current SmPC is well established and no safety action is needed, therefore this safety observation is not considered validated. It is recommended that autoimmune hepatitis and microvesicular steatosis will undergo routine pharmacovigilance monitoring and will be reassessed if further data is received."

In PSUR  (13 Oct 2006 to 12 Oct 2009), the authors of a literature article argue that grapefruit juice can augment the bioavailability of ethinyloestradiol by inhibiting CYP3A4. According to UCB, Bergamottin (a constituent of grapefruit) is a known strong-to-moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450. Interaction with grapefruit juice or other CYP3A4 inhibitors, and potential for increased risk of adverse events from this combination will be closely monitored.No cases of drug interaction with grapefruit or other CYP3A4 inhibitors were reported during the period covered by the last PSUR (13-Oct-2009 to 12-Oct-2012).

Tooth discoloration is labbeled as rare. In the Ferrous(II) glycine sulphate complex PSUR covering 01-Jan-2009 to 31-Jan-2012, 4 cases describing skin discoloration and 1 case describing pigmentation disorder have been identified. All the cases were nonserious. 2 cases (008988 & 002556) were consumer reports. Considering events chronology and positive dechallenge in some of the reported cases, the role of ferrous glycine sulphate in the development of skin discoloration can be suggested. However, considering the multifactorial nature of this disorder and the lack of details in most of the reports, it is considered that further close monitoring of skin discoloration is required for a firm conclusion. The PSUR concluded that based on the above described data, no updates of the Reference Safety Information are proposed. On 06-June-2013, a restrospective query has been run on ET DB with 11 cases of Skin discolouration (with 3 cases of positive dechallenge).

Furthermore, electrolyte imbalances are known to be associated with cardiopulmonary events and both MgSO4 and furosemide use may cause significant fluid and electrolyte loss.

Therefore, although hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine are usually considered safe for short-term use during breastfeeding and lactation, and potential neonatal adverse events identified are considered rare, it is suggested that during routine pharmacovigilance, greater emphasis is placed on the monitoring for excess sedation or respiratory depression (due to hydrocodone) and drowsiness and irritability (due to chlorpheniramine) in infants during breastfeeding, and to also monitor for any possible lactation problems experienced by the mother (due to anticholinergic properties of H1 antihistamines)."Hydrocodone/Chloropheniramine - 92	92	Hydrocodone/Chloropheniramine	all	all	Alexandre Marchand/David Richardson	Medication error (particularly in children < 6 y.o.)	yes	NA	NA		To be clarified (listed as AE in close monitoring)	UCB	to be clarified	L	Y	9/15/2013	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Complete	Stop close monitoring	"From AESM list Mar 2013.

The review of labels of similar products belonging to other manufacturers or of other antihistamines (i.e. cetirizine, levocetirizine) has not identified pancreatitis as a labelled event. No pancreatitis-related topics have been assessed in SSARs concerning either Hydroxizine or Levocetirizine. As pancreatitis was an AESM for cetirizine, an SSAR (2012) has been conducted; the signal was refuted and it was recommended to stop monitoring (in PSUR e12110036).   The diagnosis of AP in children has received growing attention in recent years, with a trend towards an increased incidence and with large differences when compared to the disease in the adult population, not only in etiological aspects but also in clinical features and treatment. Possible explanations for the increase in incidence were provided by Filho (2012); they are as follows: 1. a broader knowledge of the clinical aspects and the growing level of suspicion of AP cases (leading to growing requests for amylase and lipase biochemical tests), as well as the progressive increase in the use of drugs that may induce AP as an adverse effect, have led to a progressive increase in the number of diagnosis of the disease in recent years, or 2. an increase in cases of children with systemic diseases that affect the pancreas secondarily. Taking all of the abovementioned information into account, there is insufficient evidence to validate this potential safety observation at this time. No further assessment is needed."

The dictionary mention that findings from a retrospective review suggest that the anticoagulant effects of acenocoumarol may be reduced by loratadine, ebastine, or cetirizine. In 2008 PSUR, close monitoring of reports suggestive of a drug interaction between levocetirizine and vitamin K anatagonists (ex: warfarin or fluindione) was implemented after review of 4 reports of INR increase, 1 of INR decrease and 1 where this was unspecified, including two cases involving fluindione and 4 of them warfarin. After further review of the cases and also taking into account that INR destabilization is a rather frequent event in patients treated with anticoagulants, no substantial evidence was present for a safety signal. Nevertheless, reports suggestive of a drug interaction between levocetirizine and Vitamin K antagonists were closely monitored. In PSUR 2012, only two cases were reported describing patients who developed coagulation problems whilst concurrently receiving levocetirizine plus the anticoagulants: warfarin. During 2013 PSUR, no cases pertaining to this event were received during the reporting period. On May 8, 2013, a query of safety DB revealed 32 cases for drug interraction. Search was performed for Vitamin K antagoniste in the drug/concomitant field and the narrative section, with no other cases identified. Another query has been run on the PT: International normalised ratio ... , with no other case identified. Concidering that the event identified for this Drug interactions with Vit K antagonists is INR destabilization, knowing that this is a rather frequent event in patients treated with anticoagulants, no substantial evidence is present in our DB to support this SO, it has been closed.

The two data sources they used are not necessarily compatible, and the amount of valid cases discussed (about 48 for ceti, 15 for levo) are not statistically significant without case details to determine real validity. In addition, exposure to the antihistamines in certain countries were calculated based on certain assumptions, and to the authors’ admission, these numbers were not always exact. In addition, the disorders discussed are broad (from QT prolongation to ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest). In Empirica Signal, none of the closed signals for cetirizine or levocetirizine concerned cardiac events. A few cardiac events have previously been assessed as SOVs for either levocetirizine or cetirizine: arrythmia, QT prolongation, palpitations and atrial fibrillation with special attention to patients with history of atrial fibrillation as predisposing factor.

The PRAC commented on the inherent limitations of this type of study in the investigation of the research question, given its retrospective case-control design, and highlighted the challenges of research in the area.  The PRAC emphasized that, as highlighted by the authors, the two main indications for benzodiazepines, namely anxiety and sleep disorder, are early symptoms of dementia.

This discrepancy between MedDRA and EMA may have an impact in favor of the latter for the future detection of cases, with a predictable reduction of the total number of reports with medication error. It was demonstrated that the AEs mostly reported in all periods were mainly associated with sopor and confusional states (12 cases) which are expected based on the pharmacological characteristics of lorazepam and subsequently to overdose.

Safety observation validation report available in mikado CD.Rhabdomyolysis is listed in the Liposcler® (Lovastatin) SPC but the interaction between lovastatin and azithromycin is not. According to the Micromedex dictionnary, concurrent use of AZITHROMYCIN and LOVASTATIN may result in an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. (Severity moderate, good documentation). According to the Stockley's Drug Interactions dictionnary, pharmacokinetic studies show that clarithromycin, erythromycin and/or telithromycin markedly increase lovastatin and simvastatin exposure, slightly to moderately increase atorvastatin, pitavastatin and pravastatin exposure, and have little effect on fluvastatin or rosuvastatin exposure. Isolated cases of acute rhabdomyolysis have been reported  for lovastatin and azithromycin. In the 2 PSUR period (01-SEP-2008 to 31-JUL-2) a literature article that include the following interaction has been identified: Rhabdomyolysis and possible drug interaction Azithromycin-Lovastatin. In addition, according to the PSUR ""case reports in VigiBase are suggestive that interactions between azithromycin and statins resulting in rhabdomyolysis may occur. The long-term use of statin with a rapid onset within 10 days of rhabdomyolysis from initation of azithromycin is also indicative of a drug interaction"". Based on the review performed in this PSUR, rhabdomyolysis associated with concomitant use of lovastatin and azithromycin started to be monitored. Considering the references dictionaries and the PSUR conclusion, It was considered appropriate to perform a deep assessemnt of the safety observation (see SO report).

Although there were no signficant safety concerns identified within the database cases, Litreature review identified a statistically significant association between the use of magnesium sulfate and pulmonary edema, and so in general causality could not be be ruled out> However, this association was identified with off-label indications as per the UCB SmPC - either eclampsia prevention, fetal neuroprotection or preterm labor (as tocolytic agent) including seizure prophylaxis. The signal of pulmonary edema does not apply to the UCB specific indication (for the treatment of magnesium deficiency where the oral route of administration may be inappropriate), and does not impact the benefit-risk balance for the UCB magnesium sulfate product, which remains positive. Limited data is currently available to definitively confirm the impact of off-label use of the UCB product in association with pulmonary edema at this point in time. UCB stated that it was therefore open to consider any relevant updates of the UCB SmPC, if deemed necessary for this signal that  is associated with indications that are off label for the UCB product, should it be requested by the lead member state or health authority accordingly.

In 2009 PSUR (21 Dec 2004 to 30 Apr 2009), three case reports of AGEP were published by the same authors during the reporting period. In all three cases polypharmacy was reported but in each case there was a temporal relationship with the onset of the skin reaction and the start of the omeprazole and a positive dechallenge was also noted. Hypersensitivity reactions and a number of serious skin reactions are listed in the reference safety information but AGEP is not specifically listed. No changes to the current labelling are proposed. AGEP will be monitored. In 2012 PSUR, one published case (Momin et al) of AGEP was identified during the reporting period (case 001630: elderly polymedicated patient suffering from end-stage multiple myeloma and experienced AGEP). The authors stated that the patient received several medications that have been reported to induce AGEP. Due to the gravity of the patient’s medical status, it was difficult to obtain any history of drug-induced reaction. Therefore, the diagnosis was based on clinicopathologic correlation. On 29-May-2013, a restrospective query has been run on ET DB with still the 4 above described cases identified for AGEP.

In 2009 PSUR, one case of systemic lupus erythematosus (000705) and one case of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (000706) in a patient with history of systemic lupus erythematosus were received during the reporting period. The authors reporting case 000706 cited four other cases of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus induced or exacerbated by other PPIs. No cases of lupus have been received by UCB prior to the reporting period but one isolated report of arthralgia in a patient with a hereditary myopathy receiving omeprazole was cited in Martindale (1) which was reported to represent one aspect of a drug-induced lupus syndrome, being accompanied by malaise, fever, Raynaud's phenomenon, raised antinuclear antibody titres, and anticardiolipin and antihistone antibodies. Symptoms resolved on withdrawal of the drug(21). Lupus is not a listed event in the reference safety information and based on these few case reports no changes to the current labelling are proposed. Cutaneous and systemic lupus will be monitored. In 2012 PSUR, one case 016726 was identified from the literature (Sivakumar et al.) and described an elderly male who developed drug-induced lupus erythematosus 2 weeks after initiation of omeprazole. Positive dechallenge was noted after discontinuation of omeprazole. UCB has identified lupus erythematosus as a safety signal associated with PPI treatment. During routine signal detection procedures within UCB, lupus erythematosus was identified as a potential safety signal associated with omeprazole treatment. A Signal Detection Assessment report (SDAR) was issued in 2, including analysis of cases in the pharmacovigilance database, literature and textbook review, and labelings of similar products. The SDAR concluded that although the number of identified reports of lupus erythematosus is relatively small, these cases do not exclude a possible association with the UCB product. However, and as UCB has decided to withdraw the marketing authorization of omeprazole in Spain, no further updates to the RSI are proposed. In the US the product is generic and follows the labeling of the innovative product. On 29-May-2013, a restrospective query has been run on ET DB with still only the 3 above cases identified for lupus (cutaneous and systemic). Considering generic status of the product in the US, no further additional  action is considered required by UCB for this event.

"" But they do not mention metabolic acidosis in the particularly relation to the accumulation of 5-oxoproline and no outside of overdose context.                                                                                                              Medical Review stored in mikado CD concluded: According to the most recent product PSUR for the paracetamol/caffeine product, an update of the product SmPC may have been recommended. This recommendation suggested that information about the risk of metabolic acidosis with therapeutic doses of paracetamol (presumably in the setting of glutathione depletion) should be added to product SmPC. However, the implementation status of this proposed SmPC change is unknown and needs to be investigated. However, given that paracetamol is presumed to be the drug component responsible for the development of metabolic acidosis, it would be prudent and appropriate to also update the SmPC of the paracetamol/codeine product as well. If approved, then these updates to the SmPCs should occur as soon as possible. If the SmPC change is implemented, then “special monitoring” of this adverse event metabolic acidosis (particularly in relation to accumulation of 5-oxoproline) in association with the use of paracetamol-containing products should be discontinued. SSAR is planned to identify the most appropriate risk minimization label statement or othermeasures for all paracetamol-containing UCB products (I.Bogatyreva)"Paracetamol-containing products  - 86	86	Paracetamol-containing products 	all	all	Alexandre Marchand/David Richardson	Interaction with warfarin and its effect on the INR	yes	NA	NA	General disorders and administration site conditions	PSUR discusisons 01-Sep-2008 - 31-Aug-2011	UCB	8/31/2011	L	Y	5/31/2013	NA	5/31/2013								Complete	Stop close monitoring	"From AESM list Mar 2013.Safety observation validation report available in mikado CD.

Although bronchospasm in pre-disposed patients (analgesic asthma) is listed in the SPC of Octadon® P 350 mg/50 mg Tabletten, the possibility of asthma development in nonpre-disposed patients, especially through paracetamol exposure during breastfeeding, is not explicitly noted. In the Octadon 2011 PSUR, they reviewed controversial article about the association between use of paracetamol and asthma, both in children and adults. Based on this review, since several publications discussed the possibility of paracetamol use and an increased risk of allergic conditions like asthma, they decided to keep 'Allergic conditions like asthma' under close surveillance. Based upon this medical review of available information and data, the safety observation of “allergic conditions” is validated for both the paracetamol/caffeine and paracetamol/codeine products. In addition, a previous Safety Observation Medical Review (now archived in Mikado CD) recommended the addition of specific information about serious, hypersensitivity-mediated skin conditions to both product SmPCs. The outcome of this recommendation is pending. Finally, based upon this medical review of available information and data, the safety observation of “asthma” in association with the use of paracetamol-containing products is not validated.  It is recommended that “special monitoring” of this event for both paracetamol/caffeine and paracetamol/codeine be discontinued. It should be noted that a recent attempt by the MAH to add “asthma” to the “Undesirable effects” section of the paracetamol/codeine SmPC was rejected by the responsible regulatory body.

On 30-May-2013, a restrospective query has been run on ET DB with 3 cases identified for Fractures. In 2011 PSUR, Paracetamol and risk of fracture have been analysed. Williams et al. (2011) reported that paracetamol may have an independent impact on fracture risk, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown (271). However, a recent study revealed that over 10 years, no differences were present in BMD alterations except a small trend towards a higher BMD gain in the spine in users of paracetamol, NSAID, ASA, and opioids compared to non-exposed patients. After adjustment, NSAID exposed patients sustained more fractures than non-users. For users of paracetamol and opioids, a non-significant trend towards more fractures was presented after adjustment and no excess risk of fractures was presented for ASA users (261). Also in publications beyond the report period, this issue is debated controversly. Therefore, it's been concluded it teh PSUR that the association between paracetamol and the risk of fracture will be closely monitored in the next reporting period. Upon additional assessment of this SO, considering the lack of cases supporting this SO, the controversly literature results and the data from the reference dictionnary, this SO has been closed as not requiring additional pharmacovigilance measures.

Of these 5 cases, 1 case (002038), described a patient who had experienced DRESS 5 days after phenoxymethylpenicillin administration implying a possible temporal association. Positive dechallenge was also suggested on discontinuation of phenoxymethylpenicillin, with positive Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) for phenoxymethylpenicillin also indicated. The literature search revealed 4 articles of interest including: 1 article where authors have also indicated a positive causality assessment for DRESS syndrome with phenoxymethylpenicillin treatment. The second article, (Lin et al, 2014) involved a retrospective study which investigated various antibiotic related severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS) (including DRESS) and identified penicillin (specific penicillin type not specified) as one of the most common causes of SCARs in general, including 2 specific cases of DRESS (refer to Table 4‒1). The remaining articles by Tanno et al (2012) (prospective study) and Chen et al (2) (retrospective study) demonstrated DRESS associated with β-lactam antibiotics (6.8% of the patient cohort) and penicillin (5% of the patient cohort) respectively. The specific β-lactam antibiotic and penicillin types were not specified in both articles (Chen et al, 2; Tanno et al, 2012). The DPA was suggestive of an abnormal increased frequency of reports exceeding EB05 threshold (>2), for the DRESS event (2.79). As per Drugdex, Drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) or DRESS is mentioned under “Immunologic effects” for penicillin V.  In light of this cumulative review, we therefore confirm the signal of DRESS for phenoxymethylpenicillin.

This is expected considering the pharmacodynamic profiles of both drugs. Considering that there is no evidence regarding any possible pharmacokinetic interaction, the current wording in the CCDS of sodium oxybate section 4.4 is considered sufficient to reflect this possible effect.
